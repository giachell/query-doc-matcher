# query-doc-matcher
This repo contains the source code to obtain the matching words between a topic (query) and a document.
The matching words are computed by taking into account also stopwords removal, stemming and lemmatization.
The matching words are ranked by tf-idf scores.

For testing purposes, there is also a demo function: `matcher.demo()`.
